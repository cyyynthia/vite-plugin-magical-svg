An all-in-one [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plugin that magically makes working with SVGs and bundling them a breeze.

Inspired by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1382838799420514317) from Preact's creator Jason Miller,
I've been looking at plugins that would let me work with SVGs, as I myself did the error of embedding SVGs as React
components. Shame!

What I wanted was a plugin that would let me import SVGs, and make a sprite of symbols and give me the identifier I
can use in `<use href='???'/>`. And I couldn't find any decent plugin that makes working with them easy. They all had
a problem that made using them a pain, or outright impractical. Here's a list of the problems I encountered:

 - References in SVG files are never processed. `<image href='...'/>` would never get processed and the referenced asset is ignored.
 - The generated sprite include ALL icons, even unused ones. Just picking the right icons from a pack isn't an option.
 - There are no options to output to a separate file and reference it. Inlining is apparently the only way.
 - Selectively tell to not process a specific SVG isn't possible (e.g.: A logo, or SVGs that break when encapsulated in a symbol).
 - You can't make different sprites, it's only all-in-one.

So I decided to make my own tool to solve all this problems. Introducing: the Magical SVG plugin. ðŸª„

## Install
```
pnpm i vite-plugin-magical-svg
yarn add vite-plugin-magical-svg
npm i vite-plugin-magical-svg
```

## Usage
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import magicalSvg from 'vite-plugin-magical-svg'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    magicalSvg({
      // By default, the output will be a dom element (the <svg> you can use inside the webpage).
      // You can also change the output to react (ou preact) to get a component you can use.
      target: 'preact',
      // By default, the svgs are optimized with svgo. You can disable this by setting this to false.
      svgo: false
    })
  ]
})
```

### `exports` note
This plugin **does not** respect the `exports` field when importing svg files from third-party packages such as
`simple-icons`, which do not expose them.
